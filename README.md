# Global Power Plant Statistics Insight
## Overview
This project aims to provide some insight to different energy sector perspectives in a time where power plants use a variety of fuel types to achieve maximum generation. This project is not meant to predict which fuel type is best nor does it account for environmental data as there are many external factors I do not have access to.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the GPPD (Global Power Plant Database) to infer from.
